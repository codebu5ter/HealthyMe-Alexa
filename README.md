# HealthyMe: Health & Wellness Tracker for Amazon Alexa
An Alexa Skill that tracks the user’s daily health and wellness data like their water intake, their total hours of sleep,  and their height and weight, giving them a daily health summary with a rating based on that data. It even presents them with a Body Mass Index rating (BMI) based on their height and weight data. The user can update their health data anytime and the same will be saved in the database. In case the user’s rating isn't up to mark in certain areas, they’ll be motivated to get in shape and better their health.
